## BreederTron3000 Robot Mode
If you are too lazy to place the required foundation blocks by yourself you can make an OC robot do it for you!  
Simply:
1. create an OC Robot (MUST have a keyboard, a screen, a wireless network card (T2 recommended), an inventory upgrade and an inventory controller upgrade).
2. Run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FrostyFire1/GTNH_OC_SCRIPTS/main/BreederTron3000/robotSetup.lua && robotSetup`
3. Place the robot so it faces the foundation spot for your apiary/alveary
4. Run the command `robot`
Remember to put a charger next to your robot!
